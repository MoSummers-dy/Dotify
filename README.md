## App Description
Dotify is an Android Music app which users can listen to music on the cloud. This is the concept screen with some simple functions. Users can click the three buttons at the bottom, change the user name, and change the text color if they long press on the album cover.

## Extra Credits Attempted
- A user is not allowed to apply a new username if the edit text field is empty
- Long pressing on the cover image changes the color of all text views to a different color
- If using ConstraintLayout, utilize a Barrier or Guideline somewhere with a view constrained to it
- All hardcoded dimensions & colors are extracted into res/values/dimens.xml & res/values/colors.xml respectively
- The album cover image must be a perfect 1:1 square size whose width matches the screen width and height matches the height as well
- Create another xml file that uses the a different ViewGroup type than your original.
